(
    It is tool used for package managment and the default package manager for NODE projects. It comes with a CLI(command
    line interface) used to interact with it's online database, to update or add a package. This databse is known as NPM
    Registry, and it hostspublic and private 'packages'.
    npm alternative is yarn(The intention behind developing yarn(at that time) was to fix performance and security
    concerns with npm)
    command - npm init OR npm init -y (THis command skips many setup steps and npm will automatically create package
    json file without configuration)
